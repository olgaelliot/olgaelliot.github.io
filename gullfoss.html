     It was just some water, falling. Sure some of it rose as well, but it mostly just fell. Can't recommend.

    <div class="text2">
    The falls are quite spectacular. Unfortunately the site is full of tourists and you actually need to queue to see something. This honestly ruins the experience.

     Car park was skating rink. Paths were even worse. Having fallen over before reaching path where others struggling to keep afoot decided to leave with bones intact. Many others on trip didn't risk it either. Probably better in summer

    <div class="text4">
     Car park was a skating rink. It was impossible to walk down the paths to the waterfalls as these were completely iced up and very dangerous. 15 of our party didn't even attempt the path and of those who did more than half didn't go any further then the first viewing platform due to the ice on the steps and paths. Very dangerous.

     not impressed by it. It's a waste of time, the waterfall is tiny, the place crowded, not worth a whole day on the bus just to see this.
